# endpoint-verification-any-linux (AMD64)

This project adapts the Debian/Ubuntu-only 'Endpoint Verification' native helper for any AMD64 Linux distro by manually downloading the latest .deb, patching device_state.sh to hardcode OS_VERSION to `18.04` (the script can only detect versions for Debian or Ubuntu), and installing the system service and Google Chrome/Chromium native message helper application.

## Using it

1. Clone or download this repo
2. `cd` to the root of this repo
3. Run `./download-unpack-latest.sh`
4. If this succeeds:

- run `sudo ./install-systemd.sh` on e.g. Arch Linux and other systemd-using distros
- or `sudo ./install-rc.d-systemctl.sh` to use Google's built-in install script on distributions that have 'update-rc.d' but use 'systemctl .. start' to start services.

The install script will **ask** you whether you wish to install the Native Messaging helper application for **Google Chrome** and/or **Chromium** (they use different paths). It seems to work fine in Chromium.

## Future work

- It should be reasonably easy to adapt this script's approach to other non-Debian Linux operating systems. It's been tried on Arch Linux, and nowhere else yet.
- The script could be adapted for 32-bit systems: There is a corresponding 32-bit .deb. Does anyone need this?
- See 'Issues' tab
